# Leaflet Challenge

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

### 2-BasicMap

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

#### Get your dataset

1. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.
2. Choose a dataset to visualize (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").
3. Click on the chosen dataset to get a JSON representation of the data.

#### Import and visualize the data

1. Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
2. Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by the size of data markers and the depth by color. Higher magnitudes should appear larger, and greater depths should appear darker.
3. Provide popups that offer additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

#### Create a legend

1. Create a legend that provides context for your map data.
2. The legend should illustrate the correlation between earthquake depth and color, as well as earthquake magnitude and marker size.
